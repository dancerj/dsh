dsh for Debian
--------------

This is a distributed shell for Debian/Beowulf project.
Something that I would have liked, and everyone else have liked,
but have not (apparently) existed in Debian.

This program supports update-cluster.
You can manually run update-cluster-regenerate when you install this 
package, to configure dsh with update-cluster configuration.
Please see the documentation for update-cluster


The author has a home page at 
  http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/
and the primary page for dsh is at

enjoy.
