Known bugs:

* dsh -ic does not terminate when remote program terminates, it only 
  really terminates when local connection is terminated.

Some wishlist:

* fanout with dshd opening connections, through ssh.
* Some kind of FIFO set up, with something listening onto it.
* Bug with fanout option, rsh requires some quoting. Dsh does not preserve the quotings.
* rsh with timeout : rsh does not time out and fail... bug in rsh ?
* implement dcp
* in.drshd for dummy connection.
* ssh timeout configuration, can you change the time it takes to
   timeout?
* ldap option, fork option for machine list
* per-machine ssh/rsh specification.
