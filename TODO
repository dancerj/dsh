Some wishlist:

* fanout with dshd opening connections, through ssh.
* Some kind of FIFO set up, with something listening onto it.
* Bug with fanout option, rsh requires some quoting. Dsh does not preserve the quotings.
* rsh with timeout : rsh does not time out and fail... bug in rsh ?
* implement dcp
* in.drshd for dummy connection.
